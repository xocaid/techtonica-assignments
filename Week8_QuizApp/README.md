# Build a Game/Quiz

The goal of this project was to build a game that fetches data from an external API, connecting the backend and frontend for a seamless user experience. This project uses Node, Express, and a free JSON API, [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The [Build a Quiz App tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-quiz-app-using-react/) was used for guidance.
