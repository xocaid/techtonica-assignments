# Little Library

## Description
This project is designed to help manage your books using a simple and user-friendly interface. You can create, read, update, and delete books using a RESTful API. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, while the frontend uses DOM manipulation techniques. As we are not familiar with databases, the project uses JSON files to organize and handle the data. The books.js file is customized with your own data. The backend includes a special route that allows you to retrieve all books in a JSON format. Each CRUD operation (create, read, update, and delete) is implemented as a separate route in the backend. It's a beginner-friendly project that provides hands-on experience with Node.js, Express, and API development.
