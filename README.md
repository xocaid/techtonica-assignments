# Techtonica Projects 2022

## Description
Here, you will find a collection of projects that I built while at Techtonica, a rigorous six-month, full-time, project-based software engineering training program. Each project represents my growth and showcases the diverse range of skills I acquired throughout the program.

These projects delve into various topics, including CSS, HTML, JS DOM, and full-stack JavaScript. With hands-on experience, I learned how to seamlessly connect front-end and back-end components using cutting-edge technologies like React, Express, Node, and PostgreSQL.
